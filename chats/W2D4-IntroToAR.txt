PART 1:
11:07:31	 From Simon Jacobs : I think what Sylwia means is that :name is not the same as name, so when we interpolate we’re translating it to the value of name (or age or fear etc)
11:07:34	 From Simon Jacobs : I think
11:07:53	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Simon
11:09:47	 From Josh Frank : Great question Michael
11:11:33	 From Josh Frank : So you can use _ where normal humans use commas in order to make numbers more readable?
11:11:39	 From Josh Frank : Numbers in excess of 1,000?
11:12:46	 From Josh Frank : Can we use meta programming to write our attr_accessor?
11:15:25	 From Josh Frank : https://blog.yechiel.me/
11:15:29	 From Josh Frank : suicidal_file.rb
11:16:08	 From Josh Frank : Yechiel means “He shall live” in Hebrew I think
11:21:54	 From Josh Frank : bahahahaha
11:23:46	 From Josh Frank : How many arguments can .send() take?
11:31:33	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Unless you’re me, and that doesn’t fix your gem errors =(
11:31:47	 From Josh Frank : Poor thing Danny >.<
11:31:50	 From Josh Frank : It’s happened to me too
11:32:57	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Colorize!
11:34:21	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : I can chat with you after lecture Woodelin and try to help
11:34:32	 From Josh Frank : YER A WIZARD DANNY
11:34:52	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : I mean.. my gems are still half broken, so don’t expect too much magic haha
11:35:00	 From Josh Frank : ACCIO GEM
11:35:20	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : You can install it globally but it is better to bundle install in the local directory to prevent errors
11:35:29	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Hasibul
11:35:57	 From Woodelin Florveus : thanks danny your the man again and again
11:36:01	 From Josh Frank : ^
11:36:25	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : React packages can get really big, but gitignore files will help you keep your clone clean and lean when you push to GitHub. (Something we will discuss later)
11:39:10	 From Josh Frank : We’ve been using binding.pry - why not Pry.start?
11:39:45	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : (Good blog topic *hint hint*)
11:39:52	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Sylwia and Hasibul
11:42:41	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Sounds like Pry.start allows you to explore everything. bdingin.pry stops the program at a specified point
11:43:00	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Danny
11:43:09	 From Josh Frank : Looks like Rake is like a storage locker for your program
11:50:45	 From Josh Frank : Rubinia
11:50:52	 From madiwa simon : simple
11:56:54	 From John Wisneski : Will active record help SQLite with FULL OUTER JOIN ?
11:58:33	 From Josh Frank : Sweet lord I hope so John
11:58:38	 From Josh Frank : >.<
12:02:35	 From John Wisneski : can we clean up the timestamp on the file name?
12:10:12	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : For the create timestamp? Generally no
12:14:59	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : Amazing code
12:15:30	 From Melissa Faulner (she/her) : Do not touch it
12:15:30	 From Jordan Carroll : do not touch
12:15:31	 From Simon Jacobs : Touch it
12:15:31	 From John Wisneski : touch it
12:15:32	 From Alex Marz : Touch schema
12:15:32	 From Sam Hall : Don’t touch schema!!
12:15:35	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Never touch any of the files that migrate makes
12:15:36	 From Jordan Carroll : look but don’t touch
12:15:36	 From victor cordero : Don’t touch it
12:15:36	 From Woodelin Florveus : do not write in schema
12:15:36	 From Jonathan Brinson : Do not touch schema
12:15:40	 From Josh Frank : Y U TOUCH SCHEMA
12:15:43	 From Lauren Gifford : no touchy
12:15:58	 From Woodelin Florveus : schema boujie
12:16:10	 From Jonathan Brinson : lol
12:17:27	 From John Wisneski : IF we do type as Boolean will it be back to True/False in Ruby or the 0,1 SQL true/false?
12:17:39	 From Josh Frank : Hey John, SQL doesn’t have a boolean type
12:17:47	 From Josh Frank : It’s gotta be an integer, 1 for true, 0 for false
12:18:25	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Right Josh, but since active record is Ruby language, which do we use?
12:18:25	 From John Wisneski : You are able to call it Boolean SQL just will do it as 01
12:18:42	 From Alex Marz : Josh is that Blob(binary)
12:18:48	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Alex
12:20:51	 From Josh Frank : Great question thanks John
12:21:27	 From menachem margolis : So “name” etc will be the columns in the database ?
12:21:45	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : Yes ^
12:21:46	 From Josh Frank : I believe so Menachem
12:21:51	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Hasibul
12:21:54	 From menachem margolis : Thanks
12:22:25	 From Alex Marz : Everything that we were learning in the SQL labs, is active record just intuitively creating for us?
12:22:32	 From Alex Marz : Oh nvm she just said that lol
12:22:48	 From Josh Frank : Thanks for clarifying Alex
PART 2:
13:34:46	 From Josh Frank : TOUCHETH NOT THE SCHEMA
13:35:51	 From Josh Frank : Running rake db:create_migration again will overwrite a previous schema?
13:40:03	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : When you run rake db:migrate does it run all of the down migrations? Or do you have to specify if there is more than one? Or do you only ever do them one at a time?
13:43:45	 From John Wisneski : Can you roll forward?
13:43:54	 From Woodelin Florveus : we get most of our gem files from the website you mentioned earlier i want to make sure my file have all the tools
13:48:42	 From Josh Frank : Hey Woodelin that’s right I think
13:49:26	 From Josh Frank : If you want to check if you have it, you can type “which” in the terminal
13:49:36	 From Josh Frank : So “which bundle” will tell you where bundle is if it’s installed
13:49:48	 From Woodelin Florveus : thanks josh
13:49:52	 From Josh Frank : You got it
13:54:54	 From John Wisneski : Is it best practice to add things one at a time with migration or is it okay to do several changes in a migration
13:54:57	 From Woodelin Florveus : anyone got a link to the dics
13:55:00	 From Woodelin Florveus : docs
13:55:50	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html
13:55:56	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Sylvia!
13:56:02	 From Josh Frank : Sylwia!
14:00:48	 From Josh Frank : SYLWIA’S TRICK QUESTIONS smh
14:02:56	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : (The logger is helpful in the later phases too)
14:03:06	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Hasibul
14:08:58	 From Josh Frank : Through the config file?
14:11:39	 From darien bryant : Is there a reason for all the random symbols in the database?
14:11:57	 From Woodelin Florveus : good question
14:12:04	 From madiwa simon : I think that’s the same thing as binary coding
14:12:13	 From madiwa simon : its like 0001101101101001101010110101010
14:12:21	 From darien bryant : Gotcha - thanks!
14:12:23	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : The Object-Relational-Mapping section on Canvas shows you how these methods are built. Thats what I was working on it lunch, and now I learn that we don’t have to write them ourself =(
14:12:35	 From Josh Frank : It’s because text files are usually encoded a certain way - and so the text editor is trying to read what it thinks is a text file, but it doesn’t recognize the encoding and so displays that gobbledeygook
14:12:42	 From Josh Frank : …I think
14:12:47	 From Josh Frank : Thanks danny
14:14:24	 From Josh Frank : Is git a form of ORM?
14:14:53	 From madiwa simon : Yep. All our coding environment is technically simpler way to understand all of the plain computer language. Thanks to the people before us.
14:15:12	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Madiwa
14:19:33	 From Alex Marz : So, to confirm, is everything that Sylwia is creating in rake console replacing our console.rb file?
14:23:29	 From Josh Frank : It serves the same purpose as console.rb, providing a place to play around and test things out
14:23:41	 From Alex Marz : Gotcha thanks Josh
14:23:45	 From Josh Frank : You got it
14:24:04	 From madiwa simon : Thanks josh
14:24:10	 From Josh Frank : Of course
14:39:14	 From John Wisneski : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11945227/is-there-anyway-to-undo-an-activerecord-delete-in-rails-console looks like not really but you can get safe guards like gem papertrail and other stuff
14:39:23	 From Josh Frank : Thanks John
14:44:44	 From Josh Frank : Pretty cool how different operations have different colors
14:44:55	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : I love the colors
14:45:03	 From Josh Frank : For emphasis and readability
14:45:05	 From Josh Frank : Pretty cool
14:45:36	 From John Wisneski : What happens when you create and you set the id to one in use.
14:46:05	 From Josh Frank : Good question John
14:46:24	 From Josh Frank : I don’t think its possible
14:46:59	 From Josh Frank : Thanks for asking John
14:47:46	 From John Wisneski : if you manually set an id to say 8 will the next be id 9 or will it go back to the next in the normal sequence
14:47:48	 From Lauren Gifford : ids are like social security numbers... unique per person(instance)?
14:48:03	 From Josh Frank : Seems like it Lauren
14:48:06	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Yes Lauren
14:48:11	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Danny
14:48:13	 From Jonathan Brinson : Good analogy
14:48:26	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Unless we manually change it, which we “should never ever do” =)
14:48:33	 From Josh Frank : lol
14:49:47	 From Alex Marz : The analogy holds, the only people changing SS numbers are bad and wrong lol
14:49:58	 From Josh Frank : DON’T BE AN IDENTITY THIEF GUYS
14:50:00	 From Jonathan Brinson : ^^
14:50:10	 From Jonathan Brinson : And all plants deserve SSNs
14:50:13	 From Josh Frank : MCGRUFF THE CRIME DOG IS WATCHING
14:50:22	 From Lauren Gifford : lol
14:56:16	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : Primary Key?
14:56:37	 From John Wisneski : The internet confirms
14:57:15	 From Josh Frank : TEAMWORK
14:58:15	 From Hasibul Chowdhury : Those darn gooses
14:58:27	 From Josh Frank : OXES
14:58:40	 From Sam Hall : lolol
14:58:43	 From Shmuly Levitin : boxen
14:59:40	 From Josh Frank : I think the singular is “paparazzo”
14:59:43	 From Josh Frank : :)
15:00:17	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : So in the case of Sheep, will ActiveRecord just have an annuerysm
15:00:32	 From Josh Frank : YOU KILLED ACTIVE RECORD! YOU BASTARD
15:01:13	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Thats a real question though, does it make a problem that the plural and singular are the same
15:01:23	 From Josh Frank : Great question Danny
15:01:32	 From Josh Frank : I assume it would be best to call it “sheeps” anyway
15:01:46	 From Josh Frank : Or Sheepen
15:01:54	 From Jordan Carroll : sheeple
15:01:57	 From Jordan Carroll : lolol
15:01:59	 From Josh Frank : BAHAHAHA
15:03:01	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : https://forms.gle/7KBV8Eeghj2rAjgX7
